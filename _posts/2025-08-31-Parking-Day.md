## What is PARK(ing) Day?

[PARK(ing) Day](https://www.myparkingday.org/) is a global event where community groups temporarily transform on-street parking spaces into vibrant, people-centric public spaces (called ‚Äúparklets‚Äù) for a whole day. It‚Äôs an excellent opportunity to reimagine what our streets could look like with more space for people, not just cars. It‚Äôs also a great tabling opportunity, allowing you to engage with the public and reach communities you may not have previously connected with.

## Interested in getting involved?

If your organization wants to participate please let us know by dropping us an email at [team@strongtownsottawa.ca](mailto:team@strongtownsottawa.ca)! We‚Äôll help you plan your parklet. And please add your project to the [official PARK(ing) Day Map](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe-UPTeIgh233ye9S6KQev7dZRYF0zAKC3uiThVRJeVtqP1Kw/viewform?usp=dialog).

## How it works during Parking Day:

1.  **Claim your spot:** We recommend you arrive at 11am to secure a parking spot. Find an empty parking space and pay for it ($3/hour from 9am-5:30pm). Feel free to take more than one spot if you feel like your parklet installation requires more space.
2.  **Set up your parklet installation:** Get inspired with the [PARK(ing) Day How-To Manual](https://www.myparkingday.org/how-to). It‚Äôs always a good idea to use cones, planters, or barricades to define and protect your space.
3.  **Take pictures:** This is a global event, be sure to share your photos on social media using the `#ParkingDay2025` tag so that people across the world can see Ottawa‚Äôs creative parking day installations!
