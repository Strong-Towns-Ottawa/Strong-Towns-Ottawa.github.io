Ottawa's transit system faces significant challenges in providing reliable, efficient service to all residents. The recent LRT issues have highlighted the need for a more resilient and sustainable approach to public transportation.

## Current Challenges

Our transit system struggles with:
- Reliability issues on the LRT system
- Insufficient bus service in suburban areas
- Long wait times during off-peak hours
- Limited coverage in new developments
- High operating costs per rider

## A Better Approach

We believe Ottawa can build a better transit system by:
1. Focusing on high-frequency service on core routes
2. Implementing bus-priority measures on major roads
3. Better integrating land use with transit planning
4. Prioritizing maintenance and reliability
5. Creating more walkable transit-oriented communities

## Financial Considerations

The current approach of building expensive infrastructure without sufficient ridership is unsustainable. We need to:
- Focus on cost-effective solutions
- Build ridership before infrastructure
- Ensure new developments support transit use
- Maintain existing infrastructure properly

## Taking Action

Join us in advocating for:
- More reliable transit service
- Better integration of land use and transit
- Cost-effective transit solutions
- Improved maintenance practices

Together, we can build a transit system that serves all Ottawans effectively.
