Going to test making this post with an image attached, of our sign at the Mayfair theatre on Bank Street, pushing for 24/7 bus lanes on Bank!

* Bus lanes make the city better for everyone, not just those taking transit

  * They reduce traffic for drivers

  * They increase reliability and speed for transit users

  * They provide safe lanes for cyclists and cut down on dooring

  * They increase visibility for pedestrians trying to cross the street

  * They have much higher capacity than regular car lanes, and can bring large amounts of people to sporting events
