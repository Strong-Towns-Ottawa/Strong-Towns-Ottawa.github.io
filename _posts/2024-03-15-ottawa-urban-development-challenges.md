Ottawa's rapid expansion over the past few decades has created significant financial challenges for our city. As we continue to build outward, the costs of maintaining infrastructure and providing services to low-density areas are becoming increasingly unsustainable.

## The Cost of Sprawl

Recent studies have shown that:
- Low-density suburban development generates only 10-20% of the tax revenue per acre compared to traditional urban neighborhoods
- The cost of maintaining roads, pipes, and other infrastructure in suburban areas is 40% higher per capita
- Many of Ottawa's newer suburbs are not generating enough tax revenue to cover their long-term maintenance costs

## A Better Path Forward

We believe Ottawa can adopt more financially sustainable development practices by:
1. Focusing on infill development in existing neighborhoods
2. Encouraging mixed-use development along transit corridors
3. Implementing form-based codes that promote walkable, human-scale development
4. Prioritizing maintenance of existing infrastructure over new expansion

## Community Impact

The financial burden of sprawl affects all Ottawa residents through:
- Higher property taxes
- Reduced service quality
- Limited funding for community amenities
- Increased transportation costs

Join us in advocating for more financially responsible development practices in Ottawa. Together, we can build a stronger, more sustainable city.
