Ottawa's financial sustainability is at risk due to our current development patterns and infrastructure maintenance challenges. This post examines the financial implications of our city's growth and development decisions.

## The Financial Reality

Key financial challenges facing Ottawa:
- Growing infrastructure maintenance backlog
- Declining tax revenue per acre in new developments
- Rising costs of servicing low-density areas
- Unsustainable development patterns
- Increasing debt burden

## The Cost of Sprawl

Low-density development patterns are financially unsustainable:
- Higher per-capita infrastructure costs
- Lower tax revenue generation
- Increased transportation costs
- Higher service delivery costs
- Reduced efficiency of public services

## A Better Financial Model

We can build a more financially resilient city by:
1. Focusing on infill development
2. Supporting mixed-use neighborhoods
3. Prioritizing maintenance over expansion
4. Encouraging higher-density development
5. Implementing better financial planning

## Taking Action

We're advocating for:
- More transparent financial reporting
- Better long-term financial planning
- Sustainable development practices
- Maintenance-first infrastructure policies

Join us in building a more financially resilient Ottawa.
