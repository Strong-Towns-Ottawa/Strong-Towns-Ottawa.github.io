Welcome to Strong Towns Ottawa! We are a group of Ottawa residents who are passionate about building a stronger, more resilient city through better land use, transportation, and financial planning.

## Our Mission

Our mission is to advocate for sustainable development practices that create strong, vibrant communities. We believe that by focusing on people-first urban design and financially responsible growth, we can make Ottawa a better place to live for everyone.

## Why Strong Towns?

The Strong Towns movement is based on four core principles:

1. **Financial Resilience**: Cities should be financially self-sufficient and not rely on continuous growth to pay their bills.
2. **People-First Design**: Streets and neighborhoods should be designed for people, not just cars.
3. **Incremental Development**: Small, incremental improvements are more sustainable than large-scale projects.
4. **Community Engagement**: Local residents should have a meaningful say in how their neighborhoods develop.
