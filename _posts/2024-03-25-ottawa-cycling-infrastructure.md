Ottawa has made significant progress in building cycling infrastructure, but there's still much work to be done to create a truly connected and safe bike network. In this post, we explore the current state of cycling in Ottawa and what needs to be done to make it better.

## Current State of Cycling in Ottawa

While Ottawa has some excellent cycling paths, there are still significant gaps in the network:
- Disconnected bike lanes that end abruptly
- Lack of protected bike lanes on major roads
- Insufficient winter maintenance
- Missing connections between neighborhoods

## Key Areas for Improvement

To make cycling a viable transportation option for more Ottawans, we need to:
1. Build a connected network of protected bike lanes
2. Improve winter maintenance of cycling infrastructure
3. Create safe connections between neighborhoods
4. Implement traffic calming measures on bike routes
5. Increase secure bike parking options

## The Benefits of Better Cycling Infrastructure

Investing in cycling infrastructure provides numerous benefits:
- Reduced traffic congestion
- Improved public health
- Lower transportation costs for residents
- Reduced greenhouse gas emissions
- More vibrant streets and neighborhoods

## Taking Action

We're working with local cycling advocacy groups to:
- Advocate for better cycling infrastructure
- Push for complete streets policies
- Support safe cycling education programs
- Promote bike-friendly business districts

Join us in making Ottawa a more bike-friendly city for everyone.
