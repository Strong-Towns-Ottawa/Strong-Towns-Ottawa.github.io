Ottawa's housing market has become increasingly unaffordable for many residents. The lack of diverse housing options and restrictive zoning regulations are contributing to this crisis.

## The Current Situation

Key challenges in Ottawa's housing market:
- Rising home prices outpacing income growth
- Limited supply of affordable housing options
- Restrictive zoning preventing diverse housing types
- High development charges increasing costs
- Lack of "missing middle" housing options

## Solutions for Ottawa

We can address these challenges by:
1. Allowing more diverse housing types in all neighborhoods
2. Reducing development charges for affordable housing
3. Streamlining the approval process for new housing
4. Supporting gentle density increases in established areas
5. Encouraging mixed-use developments

## Missing Middle Housing

Ottawa needs more "missing middle" housing options:
- Duplexes and triplexes
- Townhouses and row houses
- Low-rise apartments
- Accessory dwelling units
- Live-work units

## Taking Action

We're advocating for:
- Zoning reform to allow more housing types
- Reduced barriers to building affordable housing
- Better integration of housing and transportation
- Support for innovative housing solutions

Join us in making Ottawa a more affordable place to live for everyone.
