Since the recent open house for the Bank Street Active Transportation Study, which you can read my summary of [here](https://strongtownsottawa.ca/2025/09/25/the-city-needs-to-be-bold-with-bank.html), I have heard a couple people mistakenly mention that the peak hour bus lanes are all that's needed. 

Typically the opinion is that surely the delays for the buses must be when cars are the most delayed. The reasoning for this is probably that most of these people don't actually ride the bus outside of those hours, or they don't ride the bus at all, and mistakenly assume that the delays for cars and buses must be occurring at the same times.

Thankfully we have data from OC Transpo, so we don't have to guess as to when delays are the worst for 2 of our 3 busiest bus routes in the city. A member of ours put together this table that very clearly shows major delays for routes 6 and 7 both North-bound and South-bound
