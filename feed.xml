<p>Read our letter below.</p>

<hr />

<p>Dear councillor,</p>

<p>Strong Towns Ottawa would like to express concern about the current Lansdowne 2.0 plans. While we
recognise the need for improvements, replacements, densification and proper sports and event facilities,
we are not comfortable with a number of issues.</p>

<p>Strong Towns Ottawa has argued for over a year now that <a href="https://strongtownsottawa.ca/2025/09/25/the-city-needs-to-be-bold-with-bank.html">transit access to Lansdowne has to be
improved</a>, even without the new plans. During event days, Bank Street and the surrounding area are a
nightmare for both visitors and residents. Bus schedules are becoming completely unreliable, with routes 6
and 7 having the most cancelled trips. Lansdowne 2.0 will be even worse for traffic. Visitors are stuck in
traffic with engines running. The City has committed to promoting alternative forms of transportation. The
current situation at Lansdowne does not allow for other modes to thrive. For Lansdowne 2.0 to have any
chance of success, proper public transit in the form of fully dedicated bus lanes is required.</p>

<p>We believe nudging people into transit and experiencing a fast and smooth ride is important for traffic flow
and the environment. Therefore, we strongly recommend adding permanent bus lanes on Bank Street. We
believe that current discussions about bus lanes on Bank Street in the Glebe are based on fear of the
unknown while ignoring both existing travel and parking data and the bigger picture of traffic flow and air
quality.</p>

<p>While other city infrastructure is neglected or its maintenance postponed, the city takes on debt to help
make Lansdowne a success, even after the Lansdowne partnership <a href="https://ottawacitizen.com/news/lansdowne-partnership-lost-11-1-million">posted yet another loss</a>. We are
concerned about the lower number of stadium seats, which may, and likely will, increase event ticket
prices. We believe higher ticket prices will undermine equality in our city. As consumers only have so much
to spend, higher ticket prices also means that that money can not be spent somewhere else in the city.</p>

<p>Many residents have expressed frustration about the transparency of the project. If councillors and the
media already express worries about understanding the financial consequences, how are citizens expected
to understand what happens with their tax dollars? We don’t think the City has communicated properly what
happens if the plans don’t pan out. The timelines are extraordinary and cost is always increasing.</p>

<p>What are the worst case scenarios? What if the cost is going up faster than foreseen? What if a sports
team moves on? What if bands decide on smaller venues? Given the situation south of the border, today’s
models can be worthless tomorrow. Many of us feel the plans are being ushered through Council to limit
the sound of critical voices.</p>

<p>Large city projects mean that many people and lots of public money is involved. At the tail end of LRT
phase 1, we have seen several people quietly leaving their positions after a damning report on how phase
1 was handled. A project like this should have enthusiastic support from everyone at Council. It doesn’t.
That possibly only around half of City council feels comfortable attaching their name to it, is very
concerning to us.
In short, we want to stress once again that we are not against further developing Lansdowne, in fact we
encourage it, but we are nervous about accessibility, the many assumptions that are made to justify the
cost, the way the plan is being ushered through Council, and the accountability of tax dollars being spent.</p>

<p>May we ask one question? If you are planning to vote in favour, and you were asked to invest in it with your
own money, would you remortgage your house to become a partner in Lansdowne 2.0?
Respectfully,</p>

<p>Strong Towns Ottawa</p>]]></content><author><name>Strong Towns Ottawa</name></author><category term="Letters" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Strong Towns Ottawa has sent an open letter to all Councillors with our concerns regarding Lansdowne.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Automatic Speed Enforcement Cameras</title><link href="/2025/10/22/Speed-Camera-Ford.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Automatic Speed Enforcement Cameras" /><published>2025-10-22T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/2025/10/22/Speed-Camera-Ford</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2025/10/22/Speed-Camera-Ford.html"><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">

</div>

<p>Premier Ford,</p>

<p>We are extremely concerned about your directive to remove speed safety cameras in Ontario. Along with the Association of Municipalities, the CAA, Ontario police forces and the Ontario Traffic Safety Council, we believe in the evidence that previously collected data show: fining people who don’t comply with speed limits helps: it leads to drastic safety improvements.</p>

<p>This makes a good case for continuing the use of cameras to maintain speed compliance. The ultimate goal of speed enforcement is obviously that people adhere to speed limits. Existing data shows that speed compliance quickly improves and is maintained after cameras are installed. Fewer and fewer tickets are being issued by each camera every year.</p>

<p>This trend is already happening: in Ottawa, as the enclosed graph shows, speeds have considerably dropped at road segments where cameras have been placed. Speed cameras work! Cameras in Ottawa are overwhelmingly placed in areas near schools. Removing cameras would recreate dangerous situations in those school zones. And let’s not forget people with disabilities and our aging population, who may take longer to cross roads.</p>

<p>Many safety experts strongly support the use of automatic speed cameras as does the majority of Ontario drivers (73%). In Ottawa, speed compliance went up from 16% to 81% in speed camera zones; the instances of high end speeding in those zones went down from 14% to less than 1%. Those are amazing results.</p>

<p>Therefore we ask you to reconsider an end to speed enforcement with cameras and allow technology to do its work to protect the lives of Ontarians. Using cameras allows police officers to do other important work. This is about safety for every Ontario resident, not a cash grab.</p>

<p>Respectfully,</p>

<p>Strong Towns Ottawa</p>

<h2 id="last-nights-open-house">Last Night’s Open House</h2>

<p>Last night the City of Ottawa held an open house for the <a href="https://engage.ottawa.ca/bank-street-active-transportation-and-transit-priority-feasibility-study">Bank Street Study</a> that looked at improving transit, active transportation, and accessibility to Bank Street, in the section between Lansdowne and the 417. To anyone who’s familiar with <a href="https://strongtownsottawa.ca/bank/">our work</a> on this, you’ll know we want this area to be made into a wonderful area for shoppers, residents, commuters, and businesses.</p>

<p>The city presented their proposal, which seeks to turn the Northbound peak morning travel lane into a bus only lane, and likewise for the Southbound. It would also turn both outer lanes into bus-only lanes during large events (things like Redblacks games that see ~20,000+ people come to Lansdowne) on weekends, which only occur ~15 times a year according to the city. There were two very tiny sections near Fifth avenue and the bridge to Old Ottawa South that will see full 24/7 bus lanes.</p>

<h3 id="the-citys-current-proposal">The city’s current proposal</h3>

<p><img src="/uploads/OpenHouseBankStreetRedesignVisual.avif" alt="OpenHouseBankStreetRedesignVisual.avif" /></p>

<p>After the city’s presentation, where they discussed the benefits of improving transit in the corridor, about how small of a percentage (7%) of the local parking is on-street along Bank, about how under-utilized that parking is (sits less than 50% used for the majority of the day), and so many more points that would lead you to the conclusion that full dedicated bus lanes were the obvious choice, we were then presented with a watered down version that tried to “compromise”, but instead gave us a half-baked result that seeks to please “everyone” and instead pleases no one.</p>

<h2 id="how-did-people-respond">How did people respond?</h2>

<p>The city opened the floor to allow for questions and comments, and for the next hour we heard from all sorts of citizens. We heard from young students, we heard from retired citizens, we heard from Glebe residents, we heard from parents of children who want safer cycling, we heard from citizens who cycled in, pedestrians, shoppers, workers, transit riders, and more. <strong>Every single person without question (besides the BIA representative) said this project does not go far enough.</strong> Person after person got up and said we need to be bolder. They said we need to have a solution that works for everyone, and this half-measure works for nobody.</p>

<p>They pointed out that this does absolutely nothing for small and medium events like 613Flea, the farmer’s market, the winter market, concerts, smaller sporting events, etc… They pointed out that this does nothing for the students who rely on the 6 and 7 and often bus outside of “peak hours”. They pointed out that this does nothing for weekends where Bank turns into a parking lot as cars try to parallel park and slow down everyone else behind them. They pointed out that this does nothing for the other 16 hours of the day where buses are forced to pull in and out between parked cars, getting bogged down, leading to less reliable service and higher costs to run our transit system. They pointed out that cyclists will still be at risk of getting doored when trying to cycle safely along this vital corridor to visit local shops.</p>

<p>Every single group said unquestionably that they wanted more from the city, and not more parking, but more bus lanes! As someone who attends a LOT of public engagements and open houses (yes — I’m a loser) I have truly and honestly never in my life seen something this overwhelming. In a room full of close to 150 people, all we heard was rounds of applause at every single comment of the over 20+ speakers that said they wanted better bus lanes, that this vision did not represent them, and that it didn’t go far enough.</p>

<p>All that we unfortunately heard back was about finding a “balance”. But who are we balancing with? The fewer than ~140 parking spots along Bank that mostly sit un-used? The misguided opinion that those spots, and not the local residents that visit shops on a regular basis, the cyclists who come multiple times a month, the workers at the stores who rely on our deteriorating transit system, are the ones that actually make those businesses thrive? We certainly didn’t hear from anyone, besides the representative for the local BIA, that the few parking spots on Bank Street were so vital that we should under no circumstances remove any of them to make the rest of the street better and more accessible to people.</p>

<h2 id="how-vital-is-this-on-street-parking">How “vital” is this on-street parking?</h2>

<p>As we can see from the city’s data below, the on-street parking is extremely under-utilized on Bank. Generally best practices for parking usage is that you want it to not be sitting mostly empty, otherwise that space could be much better used for other needs (such as improving transit). Ideally you want your parking to be used with ~70-85% so that on each block you’ll typically have 1 or 2 spaces available for anyone to use that needs it. You also don’t want to have your parking used so much that it is impossible to find a spot, as that incentivizes people to  circle the block over and over to find parking. As you can see, the on-street parking on Bank rarely if ever gets close to that sweet spot, and is very often sitting closer to below 50%, or above 90%, a.k.a. being severely misused.</p>

<h3 id="bank-on-street-parking-south">Bank On-Street Parking South</h3>

<p><img src="/uploads/bankStreetParkingUsageGlebeSouthWithPurple.png" alt="bankStreetParkingUsageGlebeSouthWithPurple.png" /></p>

<p><strong>Legend :</strong></p>

<p>Red : Parking under 50% utilization</p>

<p>Orange : Parking utilization between 50-60%</p>

<p>Yellow : Parking utilization between 60-75%</p>

<p>Green : Parking utilization between 75-85%</p>

<p>Purple : Parking utilization over 85%</p>

<p>A quick note about the above 90%, you’ll find that this almost only ever occurs at times when the parking is free (Sundays, and in the evenings). What this means is that we’re not actually charging appropriately for the parking at those hours, because it is being over-utilized, and someone who might really want that parking cannot get it, because people are leaving their cars in a location where they might not actually need to.</p>

<h2 id="other-parking-options">Other parking options</h2>

<p>One thing to keep in mind is the 2nd Avenue garage. It is a garage that fits as many parking spots as the the whole section of Bank Street from Lansdowne to the 417. Yet according to city data, and our own experience every time we are out there at some of the busiest times, it sits almost completely un-used. If parking was so in demand, surely this parking garage would be much more full than the data tells us it is, right?</p>

<p>Well… the data seems to tell us a different story. As you can see below, using the same colouring scheme as the on-street parking, we can quite shockingly see that there’s a LOT of red here. There is almost literally never a time where the parking is being used over 50% in the 2nd avenue garage, yet it’s less than a 10 minute walk to almost the whole section of Bank Street, almost perfectly situated right in the middle.</p>

<p>Also important to keep in mind is the below is only publicly available parking, but there are also plenty of businesses that have parking of their own. Kettleman’s, Popeye’s, McDonald’s, etc… all have their own parking lots, which means there’s even more available parking on the street that gets missed here.</p>

<p>According to city data of close to 3000 responses the vast majority of people coming to Bank are happy to walk 5-10 minutes to get to the shop they want to go, and the beautiful thing about a bit of walking is they might encounter a new shop along the way that they didn’t know about! This is wonderful for businesses, we know from plenty of data that the more people you have walking near your store the better your business does.</p>

<h2 id="so-where-does-this-leave-us">So where does this leave us?</h2>

<p>Currently the project is clearly not ambitious enough. It seeks to find “balance”, but the “balance” is mostly just keeping the status quo. The bus lanes will only be swapping out what were previously regular travel lanes in each direction during peak hours.</p>

<p>The numbers that the city quotes as “improvements” to transit might not jump out at you initially (they quote about 1 minute improvements), but the reason for this is because they only compare the improvements to how the transit currently runs when there are 2 travel lanes in the peak direction. What this completely misses is that much of the delays that the buses see in these areas is not during the times when the lane they are loading and unloading passengers on is a travel lane, but instead during the rest of the time when the outer lanes are parking.</p>

<p>Each time a bus has to pull in and out of a stop is adding significant delays as it tries to merge back into heavy traffic. With a corridor as busy as this, with so many cars, pedestrians, cyclists, etc… that leads to much more stress and confusion for bus operators, who already have a stressful enough job. This also leads to an extremely complicated, delayed, and potentially dangerous, experience for everyone else on the road, including drivers.</p>

<p>What this means is that during the times when we would hope to see the most significant benefit, which is during hours where parking is allowed on the outer lanes, we have done absolutely nothing to improve the situation. Yet these are the times when our transit needs the most help.</p>

<p>Our city should have done studies to see how much transit would have been improved in cases where parking was removed. The answer would have almost surely been substantially. We need to be bolder than this, the busiest bus corridor in our city, with 2 of the busiest buses in our whole network, deserve better than this. If we cannot take even the busiest bus corridor in the city and make improvements to it, what hope does our broader transit network have? Bus lanes are a quick, easy, and proven solution to making transit better.</p>

<p>24/7 bus lanes would make this street more straightforward by reducing signage, it would make it more efficient for drivers and transit users, it would help cyclists have a lane where they don’t have to worry about dooring, it would help transit users get to where they need to go quickly and efficiently, businesses would benefit by being more accessible to people, pedestrians would have better visibility on the street with no parked cars blocking their sight lines, it would cut down on parallel parking causing congestion, and SO MUCH MORE.</p>

<p>The best part of all of this, is it would only require us to move a tiny amount of the overall parking in the area off of the street, and as we’ve already seen, the rest of the parking capacity is easily able to soak all of that up, and more.</p>

<p>We strongly urge the City of Ottawa to take advantage of this opportunity to be <strong>BOLD</strong>. The current proposal is timid and too small to make a meaningful change considering how long it took to get here (the first open house was in June of last year). If we somehow end up being incorrect in our bet, then we fully support the city revisiting the project to make the necessary adjustments. This is the Strong Towns way: taking bets that are easy to implement, provide meaningful incremental change, and build up over time to further improve our beautiful city for everyone; be they a shop owner on Bank Street, a Student heading to class, a distant shopper, or a local resident.</p>]]></content><author><name>Marko Miljusevic</name></author><category term="Transit" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Property Tax Revenue Analysis and Dataset</title><link href="/2025/09/04/property-tax-revenue.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Property Tax Revenue Analysis and Dataset" /><published>2025-09-04T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-09-04T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>/2025/09/04/property-tax-revenue</id><content type="html" xml:base="/2025/09/04/property-tax-revenue.html"><![CDATA[<p>Tax revenue maps typically report the overall tax levy on a property in dollars. This approach favours large format developments but hides how efficiently it’s generating municipal revenues. Efficiency matters!</p>

<p>We know that the cost of most city services scale with distance. The cost of roads, transit, sidewalks, snow clearing, etc… increase the more spread out we are. So shouldn’t the city consider the revenue per hectare of a development instead, to ensure the services it provides to those residents are sustainably funded?</p>

<p>This is what we refer to as “tax revenue density”. You divide the amount of tax a property generates by its area. At scale, this type of metric is useful to show development patterns that are efficient at building wealth for the city, and which are less productive. The same way we can compare fuel efficiency of cars, dividing the tax bill by area permits apples-to-apples comparisons between properties. Large format properties are no longer favoured just because they are big.</p>

<p>Efficient land use has been a cornerstone principle of Strong Towns and firms like Urban 3 have been successful in generating stunning city renderings that show where a city is generating wealth efficiently in intuitive ways.</p>

<h2 id="ottawas-revenue-density">Ottawa’s Revenue Density</h2>

<p>The City of Ottawa recently launched an online <a href="https://propertytaxes-taxesfoncieres.ottawa.ca/en" target="_blank">property tax lookup tool</a>. Paired with the list of all city addresses, available through <a href="https://open.ottawa.ca/" target="_blank">Open Ottawa</a>, we were able to put together and visualize most of the 400,000 city addresses and collect tax information for years 2023 and 2024.</p>

<p>The data is surprisingly comprehensive. When all the property taxes are compared to the city’s official <a href="https://open.ottawa.ca/datasets/26c90c66fb8042778cd7e3685365a918_0/explore">Taxes by Ward 2022-2024</a>, the data is 94% accurate. Coverage by <a href="https://ottawa.ca/en/living-ottawa/laws-licences-and-permits/laws/laws-z/zoning-law-no-2008-250/zoning-law-2008-250-consolidation">zoning groups</a> is also very good with over 97% of Part 6 - Residential, and 84% of Part 10 - Mixed-Use / Commercial properties successfully found.</p>

<p>When we look at the city-wide average revenue density by zoning group we see how efficient Mixed-Use Downtown properties are. At the bottom, we find R1, R2, Arterial Mainstreet and oddly Transit Oriented Development (maybe it just needs more time? We’ll look at this in a future post).</p>

<figure class="text-center">
<img src="/assets/img/revenue_zoning_code.png" />
</figure>

<h2 id="comparing-properties">Comparing Properties</h2>

<p>In Ward 9 Knoxdale-Merivale, the property with the highest assessed value is a huge lot with multiple big box stores, a fast-food restaurant, and a gym. This property also pays the highest amount of municipal taxes. However, when you account for how much space it takes up, mostly for parking, it generates slightly over $130,000 per hectare. By comparison, the two most efficient revenue generating properties in the ward generate municipal revenues up to 9 times more efficiently, and people live there!</p>

<figure class="text-center">
<img src="/assets/img/revenue_ward_9.png" />
</figure>

<h2 id="citywide-3d-maps">Citywide 3D maps</h2>

<p>These data can also be rendered in 3D, like Urban 3. Here is the revenue density for all properties within the City of Ottawa’s urban boundary. It’s important to note that the height of these shapes do not represent building heights, but rather revenue density per property (did we really need to label downtown?).</p>

<figure class="text-center">
<img src="/assets/img/revenue_urban_markup.png" />
</figure>

<h2 id="seeing-the-effect-of-development-patterns">Seeing the Effect of Development Patterns</h2>

<p>We can zoom in and start appreciating where value is being generated. For example, the city-leading property generates revenue at a rate of $15,000,000 per hectare. We also see how a sidewalk facing strip mall in Rideau-Vanier and a modest 3-story townhome in Kitchissippi outperform a car dealership by several factors.</p>

<p>In the suburbs we see the same story. Large  format car-centric businesses like Costco and Landmark Cinema’s are dwarfed in revenue density by townhomes and condos. From the data it seems clear that car-centric development patterns dilute the value of properties and erodes the city of wealth.</p>

<h2 id="event-details">Event Details</h2>

<p><strong>📅 Date &amp; Time:</strong> Friday, September 19, 2025, 11:00 AM – 7:00 PM</p>

<p><strong>📍 Location:</strong> East side of Bank Street (between 1st and 5th Ave) in the Glebe</p>

<h2 id="what-is-parking-day">What is PARK(ing) Day?</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.myparkingday.org/">PARK(ing) Day</a> is a global event where community groups temporarily transform on-street parking spaces into vibrant, people-centric public spaces (called “parklets”) for a whole day. It’s an excellent opportunity to reimagine what our streets could look like with more space for people, not just cars. It’s also a great tabling opportunity, allowing you to engage with the public and reach communities you may not have previously connected with.</p>

<h2 id="interested-in-getting-involved">Interested in getting involved?</h2>

<p>If your organization wants to participate please let us know by dropping us an email at <a href="mailto:team@strongtownsottawa.ca">team@strongtownsottawa.ca</a>! We’ll help you plan your parklet. And please add your project to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe-UPTeIgh233ye9S6KQev7dZRYF0zAKC3uiThVRJeVtqP1Kw/viewform?usp=dialog">official PARK(ing) Day Map</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works-during-parking-day">How it works during Parking Day:</h2>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Claim your spot:</strong> We recommend you arrive at 11am to secure a parking spot. Find an empty parking space and pay for it ($3/hour from 9am-5:30pm). Feel free to take more than one spot if you feel like your parklet installation requires more space.</li>
  <li><strong>Set up your parklet installation:</strong> Get inspired with the <a href="https://www.myparkingday.org/how-to">PARK(ing) Day How-To Manual</a>. It’s always a good idea to use cones, planters, or barricades to define and protect your space.</li>
  <li><strong>Take pictures:</strong> This is a global event, be sure to share your photos on social media using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">#ParkingDay2025</code> tag so that people across the world can see Ottawa’s creative parking day installations!</li>
</ol>

<p>The federal <a href="https://housing-infrastructure.canada.ca/bch-mc/market-sounding-guide-sondage-marche-eng.html">Build Canada Homes</a> (BCH) program aims to address Canada’s housing crisis by accelerating the amount of housing that is built. But we must build more than just housing units; we must build communities that are financially resilient and actually pay for themselves.</p>

<p><strong>Below is the official feedback we submitted</strong>, urging the government to abandon the sprawl-based model that has left our cities with massive infrastructure time bombs. We advocate for incremental growth, leveraging existing infrastructure, and abolishing restrictive zoning to allow for more density.</p>

<hr />
<p>To the Build Canada Homes Team,</p>

<p>We appreciate the opportunity of providing input. It is our core belief that Canada’s housing strategy should not only produce units quickly, but also build places that endure financially, socially, and culturally.</p>

<p>Our past offers valuable lessons in the way cities used to be managed. The most successful cities have always grown incrementally, with durability in mind, and in compact neighborhoods that paid for themselves quickly over a reasonable period of time. This type of incremental growth brought wealth and opportunities for all people involved while creating the identity of what we have come to love as Canada.</p>

<p>However, it has been 80 years since we embarked on an experiment, a model of urban development never tried before, and it has proven now to result in the opposite of what cities used to offer. Today, our cities are inflated economic liabilities, unable to adapt to demographic and environmental changes, and over-dependent on a single mode of transportation along with the debt necessary to build and maintain the infrastructure for it.</p>

<p>BCH is a welcome initiative from the Federal Government, and we hope that by following these 6 guidelines it will generate lasting, positive impacts in our built environment:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Use Time-Tested Methods of Urban Growth</strong>: Favour incremental development patterns within existing neighborhoods that do not rely on complex financing, rather than the now common large-scale and single-use subdivisions. These historic patterns have produced the most resilient cities, both financially and socially.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Design Housing That Creates Lasting Value</strong>: Encourage building forms and site layouts that foster street life and can evolve over time to support diverse uses. Prioritize design principles, material selection, and construction methods that ensure durability and long-term livability.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Plan for Financial Productivity and Housing Affordability</strong>: Adopt a value-per-hectare analysis to ensure proposed developments generate sufficient long-term tax revenue to cover future infrastructure maintenance, and use the Federal leverage to build, assist, manage, and fund non-profits in the affordable housing space.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Leverage Existing Infrastructure Before Expanding</strong>: Densify where streets, pipes, and utilities already exist, as it reduces the infrastructure deficit and is a better use of public money.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Enable Gentle Density and Mixed Uses</strong>: Force the abolition of restrictive zoning, change financing models and review building codes, to allow for greater options in housing types (five over ones with commercial podiums, mid-rises with single staircases, family-sized units and so on) that blend into existing neighbourhoods.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Promote Innovation Without Losing Sight of Proven Principles</strong>: Support new techniques for modular and prefabricated construction to accelerate delivery, but combine this with design standards that respect the traditional urban form and land uses that actually improve our communities.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>By combining the willingness of the federal government with new building techniques and time-tested urbanism, Build Canada Homes can deliver not just houses that most can afford, but beautiful and financially resilient communities that will stand the test of time and keep alive the Canadian culture we all cherish.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br />
<strong>Strong Towns Ottawa</strong><br />
