Typically the only topic regarding affordability that is touched on is with regards to property taxes, but is that really the only way our 2026 Budget affects affordability in our city?</p>

<p>We have worked together with other groups as part of the Peoples Official Plan coalition to provide feedback on the upcoming City of Ottawa 2026 Budget. We think that much of the conversation is being missed when focusing so narrowly on “affordability”. From aspects such as housing, transportation, infrastructure maintenance, community services, the environment, and more, <strong>budgets like this proposed one will not make life more affordable for residents of Ottawa.</strong></p>

<p>The letter is included here, and we strongly recommend you contacting your <a href="https://ottawa.ca/en/city-hall/mayor-and-city-councillors">councillor and the mayor</a> to tell them how you feel about the proposed 2026 Budget.</p>

<p>09 December 2025</p>

<p>Ottawa City Council<br />
110 Laurier Avenue W<br />
Ottawa, ON K1P 1J1</p>

<p>RE: Feedback on 2026 Draft Budget</p>

<p>Dear Mayor Sutcliffe and Councillors,</p>

<p>We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the 2026 budget for the City of Ottawa.</p>

<p>At the Peoples Official Plan Coalition (POP) we focus on providing a livable Ottawa for current and future residents. While many factors play a role in livability, such as safety, opportunities for jobs, good transportation, housing options, etc… one of the largest factors is affordability.</p>

<p>POP stands with groups who are working with those residents most marginalized by increased unaffordability in Ottawa, including supporting the budget requests and priorities coming from the <strong>Alliance to End Homelessness</strong>, <strong>CAWI-IVTF</strong>, and the <strong>Ottawa Community
Food Partnership</strong>, all noting the need to prioritize the specific municipal responsibilities and levers to ensure affordable housing, transportation, and food.</p>

<p>POP additionally feels it is important to address middle class homeowners in Ottawa, and how the conversation on affordability in the City’s budget only looks at the immediate impact of taxes on residents. While this is obviously an important aspect, it only speaks to a small part of the bigger picture of affordability.</p>

<p>As per the City of Ottawa’s 2026 Budget Magazine, the proposed increase will result in “an average property tax bill increase of <strong>$166</strong> for urban homeowners and <strong>$108</strong> for rural homeowners.” This is certainly not a small amount by any means, but we would like to zoom out a bit and see how this compares to the costs that residents will bear due to underfunded services on which they rely. For reference, the $166 for urban homeowners would work out to approximately <strong>7$ a month</strong> per person in a household with 2 breadwinners.</p>

<p>One of the largest costs for families is <strong>transportation</strong>, car ownership is costing the average Canadian about <strong>$16,000/year per car</strong>. Many households are forced to purchase and maintain 2 or more vehicles due to their lack of alternative options. Our under-investment into alternative transportation modes such as public transit, safe cycling, and pedestrian infrastructure has forced residents to rely on the most expensive form of transportation
available. Even if they don’t own a car, unreliability in our transit system often leads to payinghigh prices for Ubers. These are costs that our residents wouldn’t have to bear if they were given safe, reliable, and effective transportation alternatives.</p>

<p>The largest expense in the lives of residents is <strong>housing</strong>. We are saddened to see that the amount the city will be contributing to building affordable housing has <strong>dropped by over $6 million dollars</strong> since 2024. We need both market and non-market solutions to help alleviate this housing crisis we face. Adding more non-market housing will help bring down prices for those who are living in market housing as well. By giving residents more options we are ensuring that they are able to continue contributing to the vibrant city that we live in.</p>

<p>A budget oriented toward affordability would invest deeply into <strong>climate resiliency</strong>. The climate resiliency strategy that Council recently passed, Climate Ready Ottawa (CRO), outlines numerous threats posed by climate change as well as their consequences. To take one example: severe Ottawa River flooding in 2017 and 2019 resulted in <strong>$2.6 million in direct costs</strong> to the City of Ottawa and <strong>$223 million in insured damages</strong> in eastern Ontario and western Quebec. This is to say nothing of uninsured damages, or unquantified effects on life and wellbeing. Similarly, the 2022 derecho incurred damages of <strong>$24.1 million to the City</strong> and <strong>$720 million in insurance claims</strong>. The draft budget doesn’t mention CRO, nor whether the City is funding the mere $5 million per year requested for its proposed actions that strengthen resiliency from <strong>other effects of climate change, whether extreme heat, drought, disease, or wildfire smoke</strong>. And investments in resiliency yield substantial returns, as prevention typically does: as CRO describes, “Environment and Climate Change Canada estimates that <strong>every dollar spent on proactive adaptation saves $13 to $15 in avoided recovery costs.</strong>”</p>

<p>Many interventions to increase <strong>environmental sustainability</strong> and reduce GHG emissions also increase affordability, among other goals in Ottawa’s Official Plan. Not only does supporting sustainable transportation modes, such as cycling or transit, reduce transportation costs, they also reduce the health effects of air pollution. Similarly, natural infrastructure—whether preserving natural features like wetlands and forest or building new features like native plantings, rain gardens, and bioswales—is often a fraction of the cost of “grey” infrastructure and also supports the local ecosystem, builds climate resiliency, and strengthens community.</p>

<p>Investing into our <strong>water, wastewater, and stormwater infrastructure</strong> will help ensure that residents do not have to be on the hook for catastrophic outcomes when, inevitably, the next flood happens. We have seen more and more water mains bursting which leads to a worrying trend. Taking care of our existing infrastructure ahead of disaster would mean that residents have peace of mind, and more money in their pocket for other needs. We also need to ensure we are not adding more infrastructure that cannot be maintained, as we are already struggling to make a dent in our long-term infrastructure repairs.</p>

<p>Investing into our city’s <strong>recreational facilities</strong> allows residents to avoid paying hundreds or potentially thousands of dollars a year on keeping themselves or their children active. Being physically active and healthy leads to not only a higher physical quality of life, it leads to improved mental health.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, City Council received a series of <strong>Asset Management Plans</strong> on the state of its infrastructure. The City faces, over the next ten years, a <strong>$10.2 Billion funding shortfall</strong> to maintain and replace its aging equipment and facilities. While the rate supported assets have updated their Long Term Financial Management plans, the <strong>tax supported assets, $6 Billion, have not been accounted for</strong>. The 2026 budget directions did not address these issues. These facilities will continue to get older, be closed for longer, and have their problems worsened. Our budget should be addressing the missing funding for these vital services and infrastructure; <strong>ignoring them will not lead to efficiencies, and kicking the issue down the road will only increase costs to taxpayers in the future.</strong></p>

<p>As you can see there are plenty of costs that residents have to bear when our City does not provide adequate funding for the services they need. Whether it is transportation options, housing options, greenspace, recreational facilities, or any other number of City services provided, all of them are going to cost residents a lot more to find adequate alternatives in the private sector, while still being on the hook for lackluster public options. This ends up giving us the worst of both worlds. If the City of Ottawa can find a budget that allows them to actually meet the needs of residents we are certain that even middle and upper class residents would find a lot of savings. This could come from downsizing to 1 car per household, reducing insurance costs, being able to get a membership at a City gym, rather than a private one, and much more.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>The Peoples Official Plan Coalition</p>

</div>

<p><strong>Below is the official feedback</strong> we submitted to the Ontario Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing as part of their <a href="https://ero.ontario.ca/notice/025-1100">public consultation</a> on minimum lot sizes and its impact on the housing crisis.</p>

<hr />
<p>To whom it may concern,</p>

<p>We appreciate the opportunity to comment on the proposed Provincial Planning Statement. We write from the perspective of a group committed to building a resilient, people-focused Ottawa. The PPS is an important opportunity to shift provincial planning away from financially complex, speculative growth patterns that result in a burden to municipalities, and toward a more incremental, fiscally responsible approach that strengthens existing places.</p>

<p><strong>1. Benefits and risks of reducing/removing minimum lot sizes</strong><br />
Reducing or removing minimum lot sizes in serviced urban areas enables much desired gentle density, increases housing supply, and broadens ownership options by lowering the land cost per home. It also strengthens municipal finances by allowing more households to share existing infrastructure instead of pushing growth to expensive new subdivisions. The main risks – pressures on aging infrastructure, neighbourhood resistance, and poorly designed small-lot development – can be reasonably managed through predictable form-based rules and updated servicing plans. These concerns are reasons to regulate form and servicing and not to retain large, exclusionary lot-size minimums.</p>

<p><strong>2. Best practices from other jurisdictions</strong><br />
Places that have successfully reformed lot-size rules (New Zealand 2020, Oregon 2022, Texas 2023) pair relaxed minimums with simple, predictable standards for building form, scale, and servicing. They focus on how buildings meet the street, instead of arbitrary lot dimensions. They also allow small-scale builders to participate by making approvals straightforward and by making sure different housing types do not get outlawed by regulations. The recipe seems to be consistent: remove lot-size barriers, but replace them with clear rules for height, setbacks, massing, and basic environmental performance so infill is both incremental and compatible.</p>

<p><strong>3. Situations where minimum lot sizes remain necessary</strong><br />
Minimum lot sizes are absolutely defensible where they directly protect public health and safety – such as areas dependent on wells and septic systems, floodplains, mapped unstable soils, or parcels that cannot meet emergency access or stormwater requirements without a certain minimum area. On most serviced urban lands, however, lot-size minimums function as de facto barriers to different housing solutions.</p>

<p><strong>4. Suggested smallest urban lot size and its implications</strong><br />
A reasonable provincial guideline for fully serviced urban parcels should permit lots as small as 6 m frontage with no restriction for area. This supports a wide range of missing-middle forms while preserving room for basic servicing. The opportunities include more attainable starter homes, more housing diversity, and more efficient use of existing infrastructure. Limitations would be a reduced private yard space, tighter tree-planting conditions, and potential parking pressures. All those can be addressed through complementary performance standards. Frontage and how the building meets the street should be treated as an integrated package, ensuring that parcels remain buildable, functional, and compatible with their context.</p>

<p><strong>5. Supporting zoning and performance standards</strong><br />
To make reduced lot-size rules successful, municipalities should permit additional residential units and small multiplexes as-of-right, remove parking minimums in their urban perimeters, and apply simple form-based standards for height, setbacks, lot coverage, and massing. Environmental performance should include a mix of minimum permeable surface with low-impact stormwater requirements and basic tree-planting standards.Municipalities should also plan to streamline approvals in order to enable many small, incremental projects rather than relying solely on large developments to meet their housing goals. These measures ensure that smaller lots remain developable, and contribute to a fiscally productive area.</p>

<p>In conclusion, Ontario has in its hands an opportunity to re-orient its planning framework toward financially productive, people-centered, future-proof communities. A PPS grounded in infill-first growth, gentle density,transit alignment, and incremental development will create places that are prosperous, affordable, resilient, and able to weather economic uncertainty.</p>

<p>Thank you for considering this submission.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br />

<p>Typically the opinion is that surely the delays for the buses must be at the same time as when cars are the most delayed. The reasoning for this is most likely that many of these people don’t actually ride the bus outside of those hours, or they don’t ride the bus at all, and assume that the delays for cars and buses must be occurring at the same times.</p>

<p>While I can understand where the thought might be coming from, it’s important to refer to the data on this so we can make sure we’re correctly deciding on how to use such an important bit of space.</p>

<p>Thankfully we have data from OC Transpo, so we don’t have to guess as to when delays are the worst for 2 of our 3 busiest bus routes in the city.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-the-data-say">What does the data say?</h3>

<p>A member of ours (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alex-is.online">Alex</a>) put together a table that very clearly shows major delays for routes 6 and 7 outside of when the city considers “peak hours” for their current proposal.</p>

<p>The table indicates the times it takes for the buses to get through the section of Bank where the study is located (from Aylmer to Catherine street).</p>

<p>You can see in the following image, we have the “peak hours” that the city proposes for bus lanes North-bound and South-bound surrounded by the double black lines.</p>

<p>It is clear that while the buses definitely start getting delayed North-bound from 7-9am, and South-bound from 2:30-4:30pm, the worst delays going North are actually outside of when the city is proposing bus lanes at all. Likewise going South, significant delays persist all throughout the day.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/busesOnBankDelaysDuringTheDayOutlinedTravelLaneHoursPeakHours.png" alt="busesOnBankDelaysDuringTheDayOutlinedTravelLaneHoursPeakHours.png" /></p>

<p>I had spoken to Noah Vineberg from ATU279 and anecdotally they had already told me that the worst experiences for drivers on these routes are when parking is in effect, so it’s nice to have data to back that up!</p>

<h3 id="how-about-weekends">How about weekends?</h3>

<p>I also wanted to touch on weekend delays, as it had been brought up recently with the Lansdowne 2.0 discussions, that 9-5 delays during the week weren’t too bad, and that weekends were the real issue. You will not hear me push back against bus lanes on weekends at all, but the delays on the weekend really aren’t that different from during the week.</p>

<p>As you can see below, North-bound actually looks almost exactly the same as during the week, and the only big difference is going South-bound, which adds about a minute of extra delays compared to during the week.</p>

<p>Just to be clear, this is still terrible and absolutely needs to be addressed, which is why we’re pushing for 24/7 bus lanes, which would solve both the extreme weekday AND weekend delays all at once! But we should be clear, the delay aren’t just bad “only during peak hours” or “only on weekends”, the delays are awful almost all of the time!</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/busesOnBankDelaysDuringTheWeekend.png" alt="busesOnBankDelaysDuringTheWeekend.png" /></p>

<h3 id="why-are-the-delays-so-much-worse-in-the-middle-of-the-day">Why are the delays so much worse in the middle of the day?</h3>

<p>One might think that the delay shouldn’t be too bad during weekdays outside of working hours, right? Everyone is already at work, so why are the buses being delayed? There are fewer cars on the street, shouldn’t that be great for buses?</p>

<p>The very simple answer is that during the weekdays, those “peak-hours” are actually already turned from parking lanes into travel lanes, which is why we wouldn’t actually see a large improvement from making them into bus lanes.</p>

<p>The thing that really delays our extremely important buses, and the <strong>thousands of people they move every day</strong>, are the couple of parked cars in the outer lanes. As soon as just a single car is occupying that outer lane, the bus now has to pull in, and out, of that lane every single time it has to drop-off and pick up passengers. Add up the multiple stops in just this section of Bank alone, and that leads to a LOT of delays.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-lansdowne-20-mean-for-bank">What does Lansdowne 2.0 mean for Bank?</h3>

<p>Over and over during the discussions about Lansdowne 2.0, there was a very clear issue that kept getting raised. Access to Lansdowne is extremely lackluster and needs to be improved for any chance of success for the project. Polling was done around the project, and responders identified improving transportation to and from Lansdowne as you can see below. 24/7 bus lanes are one of the only ways we could improve transportation access to Lansdowne.</p>

<p><img src="/uploads/nanosPollPrioritiesForLansdowne2RedCircle.png" alt="nanosPollPrioritiesForLansdowne2RedCircle.png" /></p>

<p>If we’re going to be investing close to half a billion dollars in this area, the very least we can do is make it easier for people from across the city to actually access. Otherwise why are we putting all of this money here?</p>

<h3 id="so-whats-the-solution">So what’s the solution?</h3>

<p>This is the beauty behind the 24/7 bus lanes, and why trying to find some “balance” between parking, of often single-occupancy, vehicles and <strong>2 of the 3 busiest buses in our city</strong>, buses which move thousands of people every single day, is going to lead to an extremely underwhelming change based on current proposals. It’s often best to just keep it as simple as possible, paint the lanes red, and let those beautiful buses ride!</p>

<p>Read our letter below.</p>

<hr />

<p>Dear councillor,</p>

<p>Strong Towns Ottawa would like to express concern about the current Lansdowne 2.0 plans. While we
recognise the need for improvements, replacements, densification and proper sports and event facilities,
we are not comfortable with a number of issues.</p>

<p>Strong Towns Ottawa has argued for over a year now that <a href="https://strongtownsottawa.ca/2025/09/25/the-city-needs-to-be-bold-with-bank.html">transit access to Lansdowne has to be
improved</a>, even without the new plans. During event days, Bank Street and the surrounding area are a
nightmare for both visitors and residents. Bus schedules are becoming completely unreliable, with routes 6
and 7 having the most cancelled trips. Lansdowne 2.0 will be even worse for traffic. Visitors are stuck in
traffic with engines running. The City has committed to promoting alternative forms of transportation. The
current situation at Lansdowne does not allow for other modes to thrive. For Lansdowne 2.0 to have any
chance of success, proper public transit in the form of fully dedicated bus lanes is required.</p>

<p>We believe nudging people into transit and experiencing a fast and smooth ride is important for traffic flow
and the environment. Therefore, we strongly recommend adding permanent bus lanes on Bank Street. We
believe that current discussions about bus lanes on Bank Street in the Glebe are based on fear of the
unknown while ignoring both existing travel and parking data and the bigger picture of traffic flow and air
quality.</p>

<p>While other city infrastructure is neglected or its maintenance postponed, the city takes on debt to help
make Lansdowne a success, even after the Lansdowne partnership <a href="https://ottawacitizen.com/news/lansdowne-partnership-lost-11-1-million">posted yet another loss</a>. We are
concerned about the lower number of stadium seats, which may, and likely will, increase event ticket
prices. We believe higher ticket prices will undermine equality in our city. As consumers only have so much
to spend, higher ticket prices also means that that money can not be spent somewhere else in the city.</p>

<p>Many residents have expressed frustration about the transparency of the project. If councillors and the
media already express worries about understanding the financial consequences, how are citizens expected
to understand what happens with their tax dollars? We don’t think the City has communicated properly what
happens if the plans don’t pan out. The timelines are extraordinary and cost is always increasing.</p>

<p>What are the worst case scenarios? What if the cost is going up faster than foreseen? What if a sports
team moves on? What if bands decide on smaller venues? Given the situation south of the border, today’s
models can be worthless tomorrow. Many of us feel the plans are being ushered through Council to limit
the sound of critical voices.</p>

<p>Large city projects mean that many people and lots of public money is involved. At the tail end of LRT
phase 1, we have seen several people quietly leaving their positions after a damning report on how phase
1 was handled. A project like this should have enthusiastic support from everyone at Council. It doesn’t.
That possibly only around half of City council feels comfortable attaching their name to it, is very
concerning to us.
In short, we want to stress once again that we are not against further developing Lansdowne, in fact we
encourage it, but we are nervous about accessibility, the many assumptions that are made to justify the
cost, the way the plan is being ushered through Council, and the accountability of tax dollars being spent.</p>

<p>May we ask one question? If you are planning to vote in favour, and you were asked to invest in it with your
own money, would you remortgage your house to become a partner in Lansdowne 2.0?
Respectfully,</p>

<p>Strong Towns Ottawa</p>]]></content><author><name>Strong Towns Ottawa</name></author><category term="Letters" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Strong Towns Ottawa has sent an open letter to all Councillors with our concerns regarding Lansdowne.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Automatic Speed Enforcement Cameras</title><link href="https://strongtownsottawa.ca/2025/10/22/Speed-Camera-Ford.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Automatic Speed Enforcement Cameras" /><published>2025-10-22T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2025-10-22T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://strongtownsottawa.ca/2025/10/22/Speed-Camera-Ford</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://strongtownsottawa.ca/2025/10/22/Speed-Camera-Ford.html"><![CDATA[<div style="text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;">

<p>Premier Ford,</p>

<p>We are extremely concerned about your directive to remove speed safety cameras in Ontario. Along with the Association of Municipalities, the CAA, Ontario police forces and the Ontario Traffic Safety Council, we believe in the evidence that previously collected data show: fining people who don’t comply with speed limits helps: it leads to drastic safety improvements.</p>

<p>This makes a good case for continuing the use of cameras to maintain speed compliance. The ultimate goal of speed enforcement is obviously that people adhere to speed limits. Existing data shows that speed compliance quickly improves and is maintained after cameras are installed. Fewer and fewer tickets are being issued by each camera every year.</p>

<p>This trend is already happening: in Ottawa, as the enclosed graph shows, speeds have considerably dropped at road segments where cameras have been placed. Speed cameras work! Cameras in Ottawa are overwhelmingly placed in areas near schools. Removing cameras would recreate dangerous situations in those school zones. And let’s not forget people with disabilities and our aging population, who may take longer to cross roads.</p>

<p>Many safety experts strongly support the use of automatic speed cameras as does the majority of Ontario drivers (73%). In Ottawa, speed compliance went up from 16% to 81% in speed camera zones; the instances of high end speeding in those zones went down from 14% to less than 1%. Those are amazing results.</p>

<p>Therefore we ask you to reconsider an end to speed enforcement with cameras and allow technology to do its work to protect the lives of Ontarians. Using cameras allows police officers to do other important work. This is about safety for every Ontario resident, not a cash grab.</p>

<p>Respectfully,</p>

<p>Strong Towns Ottawa</p>
