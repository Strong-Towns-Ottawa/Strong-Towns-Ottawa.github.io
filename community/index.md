subtitle: The way we build our cities allows for communities to thrive, or to flounder. Communities shape our everyday lives, it is vital to make sure we're building cities that foster these connections. Our streets are historically the main ways to connect the people within our cities. Making sure these places are inviting, safe, and attractive makes it as easy as possible for communities to form for all different types of people. A thriving city allows you to explore your hobbies, interests, human connections, and more without having to travel too far away from home.

<p>No person is an island. People are social creatures who crave interaction - and it turns out to be as necessary to living as food and water!</p>

<p>Social isolation is a growing issue in Canada. As fewer Canadians are living in traditional households, other means of connection are becoming far more important.</p>

<p>Studies have linked loneliness to a 50% higher risk of dementia and a significant increase in overall risk of premature death from all causes. People who get out more are also generally more physically healthy as well.</p>

<p>How places are planned and built can foster, or in many cases hinder, this vital human connection.</p>

<p>It starts with a welcoming and safe environment within which are accessible "third places" - facilities or destinations outside of work and home like cafes, places of worship, clubs, libraries, and parks.</p>

<p>These third places need to be accessible, either by foot, bike, or by transit. In addition to the infrastructure to get there, the trip needs to feel safe and inviting. We're much more likely to traverse peopled, greenery-filled streets as opposed to car traffic-heavy roads with a thin sidewalk.</p>

Think of some of your favourite places to visit in the city. You most likely don't think of any places that feel dangerous.

Places that are poorly lit, have quick moving vehicles around them, don't have protection from the shade, are loud, don't have many people around, etc... all lead to feelings of unease and danger.

Jane Jacobs often talked about the "eyes on the street" which was the idea that having more people frequenting an area made it safer, as their "eyes" kept the street safe.

By creating environments that serve many purposes and bring many people to them, we can make them feel inherently safer to be around.
