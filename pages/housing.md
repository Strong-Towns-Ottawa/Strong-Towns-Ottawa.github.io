title: Housing
permalink: "/housing/"
subtitle: Housing is one of the most important aspects of our cities. Everyone needs
  a place to live and call home, and the way we currently tackle housing is making
  this less attainable for your average Ottawan. It has become unaffordable, bland,
  and forces you to live further from necessities and amenities.

## The more barriers we put in front of building housing the less affordable our housing will be


<div class="side-by-side">
  <div class="text-content">
    <p>The most glaring issue is how much of our city is zoned for single-family housing, but add on parking minimums, minimum lot sizes, maximum building heights, minimum setbacks, etc… and it becomes a surprise that we’re even able to build any housing here, to begin with. The only housing that’s left to be created is over-expensive and extremely low-density. This stands in the way of creating a well-functioning city.</p>
 </div>
  <div class="text-content">
    <p>This isn’t to say we should remove all zoning laws, but a more reasonable approach that allows for the missing middle density that is often seen in cities like Montreal, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Paris, etc… is sorely needed in Ottawa to make our housing more affordable and function better for the diverse groups of people living in our amazing city.</p>

## A strong city doesn’t need to be extremely dense

  <div class="text-content">
    <p>Many of the cities listed above don't really "feel" all that dense, yet still achieve a great amount of density by allowing for the missing middle density that Ottawa doesn't. Having only the 2 extremes of densities leads to many feeling like they'd never be able to live in a "denser" area as the only form of density they know is skyscrapers, but this isn't the only option. Just like most things, the answer is found in a compromise of the extremes.</p>

## A city needs density to be able to provide amenities. 

<div class="side-by-side">
  <div class="text-content">
    <p>When we allow for more people to live near each other we allow for the density required to open and support a variety of stores. We then have the property tax income to keep our streets clean, our roads pothole-free, our parks lush and pampered. We provide our citizens tons of social destinations from cafes, to theatres, to pool halls. We have the people required to host fun events.</p>
 </div>
  <div class="text-content">
      <p> We have the density required to provide good public transportation, and we can provide better schools and medical services. With higher density we have the people required to be able to open up more niche shops and host small vendor markets. These groups would not be able to thrive in lower density sprawled areas, they require people to be able to thrive</p>
