Many businesses will have many more people than that at a time, many studies show businesses over-estimate how many of their customers arrived by car. Given how little on-street parking is available per business it’s also safe to assume that you already are not able to park right in front of the business that you’re visiting with the current on-street parking situation anyways, so not much will change for your average shopper.</p></div><div class="col-md-6"><p>Bank is both a very important destination, but also an important road for moving people through it. The bus lanes would help make both of those purposes better, and would help push Bank in a positive direction for people living nearby, commuters passing through, business owners, and every type of transportation mode.</p><p>At a time when our ridership numbers are falling due to service cuts we need to take the easy wins that help instill confidence in our system, bus lanes are a simple step in this direction that have been shown time and time again to help improve travel times. This would give people a choice in how they get around their city. They could choose to leave their car at home and take public transit as an option, alleviating congestion from the rest of the people who might still prefer to drive.</p></div><h2 class="text-center mb-4">What the City Is Proposing?</h2><div class="bank-street-options"><div class="row option-images"><div class="col-lg-6 col-12 mb-4"><div class="option-image-container"><img src="/assets/img/BankStreetStudyOptionA-1024x563.png" alt="Bank Street Option A" class="img-fluid rounded shadow-sm" /><p class="text-center mt-2">Option A</p></div></div><div class="col-lg-6 col-12 mb-4"><div class="option-image-container"><img src="/assets/img/BankStreetStudyOptionB-1024x579.png" alt="Bank Street Option B" class="img-fluid rounded shadow-sm" /><p class="text-center mt-2">Option B</p></div></div></div><div class="row option-details"><div class="col-lg-6 col-12 mb-4"><details class="option-card"><summary class="h4">Problems With Option A</summary><div class="details-content mt-3"><p>This option would seek to put even more fast moving vehicle lanes on a street that would be ruined by more car traffic. With lanes where cars can pass each other we will see more speeding, leading to an increase in noise and most importantly danger for everyone using Bank, especially pedestrians. Given that Bank is such a vital location for pedestrians this would lead to a much less pleasant experience. It also wouldn't solve any traffic issues as we know that more car lanes do not fix our traffic problems, also known as Induced Demand (<a href="https://youtu.be/PB_9Va0fx_o?si=Q5td57eLenEpO0ZB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here is a great short video explaining it</a>).</p></div></details></div><div class="col-lg-6 col-12 mb-4"><details class="option-card"><summary class="h4">Problems With Option B</summary><div class="details-content mt-3"><p>We've already mentioned this option previously, but to sum it up, only having bus lanes during small sections of the day leads to confusion, and tickets, for drivers. Many studies also show that temporary bus lanes gain none of the advantage of full-time bus lanes as there are too often cars remaining parked in the lanes, this ends up leading to none of the benefits you'd expect from bus lanes. The option also removes bus lanes during the most important time we'd need them, which is during large Lansdowne events. Public transportation is the only way to move large groups of people to a specific location. Not having a bus lane during those hours will lead to much more congestion during events. By providing good public transportation options you incentivize people to leave their cars at home, and thus help alleviate the need for parking as well.</p></div></details></div></div><div class="row option-images"><div class="col-lg-6 col-12 mb-4"><div class="option-image-container"><img src="/assets/img/BankStreetStudyOptionC-1024x578.png" alt="Bank Street Option C" class="img-fluid rounded shadow-sm" /><p class="text-center mt-2">Option C</p></div></div><div class="col-lg-6 col-12 mb-4"><div class="option-image-container"><img src="/assets/img/BankStreetStudyOptionD-1024x571.png" alt="Bank Street Option D" class="img-fluid rounded shadow-sm" /><p class="text-center mt-2">Option D</p></div></div></div><div class="row option-details"><div class="col-lg-6 col-12 mb-4"><details class="option-card"><summary class="h4">Problems With Option C</summary><div class="details-content mt-3"><p>Given how little parking is already on-street as is (less than 7% of the total parking) it doesn't make sense to give up a whole lane in an option just to seek to keep 71 parking spots along a 2km stretch of road. This option also removes bus lanes during Lansdowne events, just like Option B, which is a huge missed opportunity and will lead to more congestion during events. The parking will lead to the same issues we currently see on Bank which leads to lots of long backups and is the primary reason we have so much congestion in the first place. Similar to Option B, having only temporary bus lanes will lead to losing almost all of the benefits we'd expect with dedicated transit lanes as cars will be left in the space during the hours where they aren't allowed.</p></div></details></div><div class="col-lg-6 col-12 mb-4"><details class="option-card"><summary class="h4">Problems With Option D</summary><div class="details-content mt-3"><p>Cycling lanes wouldn't be a terrible alternative option to 24/7 bus lanes. Many studies show that businesses see huge improvements when bike lanes are put into the streets those businesses are on. There is still no reason to keep half of the less than 7% on-street parking in this option, this extra space could be used for wider pedestrian facilities and wider bike lanes (1.5m is the bare minimum and doesn't allow for safe passing), this would lead to a much more pleasant experience on the street for shoppers. Bike lanes would help calm the street, reduce noise, and help protect cyclists, all great improvements! Overall this is one of the less bad options the city has chosen, but given the other options of calmer streets nearby we think that Bank should rather prioritize public transportation as one of our main N-S corridors in the city, especially with the importance of moving large amounts of people to events with public transportation.</p></div></details></div></div></div><style>.bank-street-options { margin: 3rem 0; } .option-image-container { text-align: center; } .option-images img { max-height: 300px; width: auto; max-width: 100%; object-fit: contain; border: 1px solid #eee; margin: 0 auto; display: block; } .option-card { background: white; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 8px; padding: 1.5rem; box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1); margin-bottom: 2rem; } .option-card summary { font-weight: 600; color: #2c3e50; cursor: pointer; outline: none; font-size: 1.25rem; } .option-card[open] summary { margin-bottom: 1rem; } .details-content { line-height: 1.6; font-size: 1rem; } .details-content p { margin-bottom: 0; } @media (max-width: 992px) { .option-images img { max-height: 250px; } .option-card { padding: 1rem; } } @media (max-width: 768px) { .option-images img { max-height: 200px; } }</style><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><h3 style="font-size: 1.8rem; font-weight: normal">In our opinion, the city has presented the public with options that have no ambition.</h3><p>None of the options are willing to move all of the parking off-street to the alternative options permanently.

Greenspace is important for many reasons, road safety, reduced heat, shading, beauty, and so much more. Looking for inspiration from other beautiful pedestrian promenades and shopping districts a grassy-tram would help add greenspace and increase road capacity and safety!</p></div><div style="background-color: #0C2340; color: white; padding: 20px; border-radius: 8px;"><h2 id="petition">Here's How You Can Help!</h2><ul style="padding-left: 20px; padding-right: 20px; line-height: 1.5;"><li><a href="https://forms.gle/yG5VakuBtyTTq7dM8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #7FB2F0;">Sign this petition</a> which we are using to advocate to the city</li><li>E-mail your thoughts to the project manager, Lise Guevremont, at lise.guevremont@ottawa.ca</li><li>Stay updated on the project <a href="https://engage.ottawa.ca/bank-street-active-transportation-and-transit-priority-feasibility-study" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: #7FB2F0;">here</a></li><li>Join Strong Towns Ottawa and get involved in advocating!
